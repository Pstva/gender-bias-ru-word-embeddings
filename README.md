# Measuring Gender Bias in Word Embeddings for Russian Language
This repository provides the code used for the calculations of gender bias with the Word Embedding Association Test (Caliskan et al., 2017) in word embeddings for Russian Language. 

Gender bias is calculated in 7 word categories: career vs family, math vs arts, science vs arts, intelligence vs appearance, physical vs emotional strength, STEM vs humanities, rationality vs emotionality. Full lists of words with POS-tags can be found in the folder *word_sets*.
